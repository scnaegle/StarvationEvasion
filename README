We have created a game called Starvation Evasion. It is a card based game where
the goal of the game is to keep the world from having a massive famine.
How the player is supposed to keep the world from having a famine is they
initiate policies as a *politition*, which affect other players and the rest of the world.

The game is designed to be played with 7 players. Each player will be in control
of a region. The 7 regions are California, Pacific Northwest & Mountain States,
Northern Plains States, Southern Plains & Delta States, Heartland States,
Southeastern States, and The Northern Crescent States.

How the game is played is a player choose if he wants to play single player,
host a mutiplayer game, or join a multiplayer game. From there, he must choose
a region to be a senator for in the United States. The game will then begin
after all the players have chosen the region that they want to control. A player
is then handed 7 "policy cards" where he will be able to draft 2 them to be voted
on by all of the players, discard 3 of them, or do nothing. The player can also
do combinations of these types of plays with the cards.

Depending on what cards are played will determine how farmers will will plant
their crops in the players regions. Each region will *distrubute* food throughout
their region, other regions in the United States, and the rest of the world.

If the players are able to make it to 2050 without their being a mass famine
anywhere in the world, they will then compare which region has the most wealth.
The region with the most wealth will be the first pace winner, second most wealth
will be second place, and so on. It is a good idea to work with other players in
order to assure that everybody does not lose, but at the end of the game you will
have wanted to better than the other players as well.
